### Hello! 👋

My name is Anders and I am from 🇩🇰Copenhagen, Denmark. I am a passionate frontend engineer obsessed with improving software development projects, from enhancing user and developer experience to increasing maintainability and agility.

I have spent the last 4 years consulting as a frontend web developer for a dozen different companies. I have worked with many teams, technologies, and processes and love the ever-changing environment's many learning opportunities.
